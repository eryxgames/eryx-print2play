### ERYX: A Lovecraftian Fable

On the fringe of explored space, where the tendrils of charted civilization fray into the unknown, lies the desolate planet Eryx. 
Scarred by the Collective conflict, humankind seek resources for a battered Earth. **Extraterrestrial Reconnaissance & Yield Xenobiology (ERYX)** project is found and sent to reestablish outposts, mining facilities and xenoarcheology sites on the planet and its two moons. But Eryx holds a sinister truth.

Here, twisted flora and fauna serve the enigmatic Eryxians, while brutal Collective's extermination units are establishing its presence on the planet. The struggle for resources once hardened humanity, but the darkness of Eryx twists their resolve. Now, they fight not just for survival, but against the insidious whispers that threaten to corrupt their very souls.

Whispers of the Ancients, cosmic horrors from beyond the stars, fuel the planet's malevolent aura. Can humanity survive this desolate crucible, or will they succumb to the madness within Eryx's ancient ruins?
